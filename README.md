My personal website and favourite "vanilla-code" portfolio entry. A highly sustainable personal website with minimal server impact and impressive speed.

## Technical description
* Single page application (SPA) coded from scratch using no frameworks.
* Static website (HTML, CSS, JS) with component-like behaviour (only content area repaints on path change, thanks to fake "includes" using jQuery loads).
* Responsive design.
* HTML5 sematics, validated via W3C with no errors.
* Fully accessible, validated via Wave with no errors).
* And very, very light. The full thing stands at ~1MB.


## Performance
The site looks good and moves even better! It is also highly sustainable.

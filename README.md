# jbolns.github.io
This is my personal website and, also, my favourite "vanilla-code" portfolio project. In short, the site is a highly sustainable personal website with minimal server impact and impressive speed.

## Technical description
* Single page application (SPA) coded from scratch using no frameworks whatsoever.
* Coded from scratch using only HTML, CSS.
* Very light - the full thing stands at ~1MB.
* HTML5 sematics, validated via W3C with no errors.
* Fully responsive.
* Fully accessible, validated via Wave with no errors).
* Despite being a static website, it has fake "includes" via via jQuery 'loads', so only the content area repaints upon clicking a link.

## Performance
The site looks good and moves even better!

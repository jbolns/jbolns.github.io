    <p>I have been re-acquainting myself with data analytics, with the objective of launching a rather neat GovTech initiative. More on this to follow... </p>

      <summary>josebolanos.xyz (WebDev)</summary>
      <p>While you may not notice, this website is a lighting-fast static site that I coded from scratch. It uses jQuery includes to avoid unnecessary reloading of miscellaneous sections (i.e. unless the site is manually refreshed, the header, sidebar, and footer only need to load once). The size of the full thing stands at about 1MB (for reference, a Wordpress install is ~30MB, and that's before you add content - that's 1/30th the server damage!). Code available via <a href="#" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <summary>Stakeholder Mapping (Data, the Excel & VBA way)</summary>
      <p>This twin set of files aims to simplify stakeholder mapping for large organisations.</p>
      <p>It's all fairly straightforward:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Manager sends input file asking staff to enter their top-10 stakeholders and click "submit".</li>
        <li>Manager receives submissions via email.</li>
        <li>Manager saves all submissions to a common folder and clicks "join" on the main file.</li>
        <li>File joins all submissions into a single database.</li>
        <li>Manager clicks "generate map source", file converts everything into .csv files pre-formatted for use by an external mapping software.</li>
      </ol>

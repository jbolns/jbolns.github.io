  <h1>Private governance, certifications, and authority</h1>
  <h2>A very <span class="purple">interesting</span> conversation.</h2>

    <p>Certifications no longer want to be certifications; not as traditionally conceived, anyway. Instead, many are evolving into much broader frameworks to support the design of corporate, regional, and national governance.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Examples of transformation</h2>
    <p>My favourite examples are the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Gold Standard, two pioneer voluntary carbon offset certifications. Both organisations were prototypical certifications: standards, audit, label, done! However, they recently transformed significantly.</p>
    <p>VCS became Verra, an organisation that “develops and manages standards that are globally applicable and advance action across a wide range of sectors and activities”.<sup>1</sup> Verra now has several frameworks in addition to its original carbon offset certification programme, and a couple push the envelope of what it means to be a certification. Verra’s Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ (JNR) aims to help national and subnational actors develop jurisdictional rules.<sup>2</sup> Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard is a piece in a broader effort known as the 3R Initiative (3RI).<sup>3</sup> 3RI is a collaboration by civil society and private sector organisations that aims “to jointly develop an innovative and flexible mechanism to scale-up plastic waste recovery and recycling while making a sustainable social impact”.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>Gold Standard is now an umbrella framework for “creating robust standards for climate and development interventions”,<sup>5</sup> the overarching goal being to support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from different angles. With the support of the Germany Ministry of the Environment, the new organisation is working towards “a framework to transition the voluntary carbon market for alignment with new rules emerging from the Paris Agreement”.<sup>6</sup> Also, the new Gold Standard has a supply chain effort known as ValueChange, which aims to help corporate actors “reduce emissions in their value chains and to credibly report on these outcomes in line with best-practice accounting and reporting framework such as the GHG Protocol and Science-Based Targets”.<sup>7</sup></p>

    <h2>The extent of transformation</h2>
    <p>Verra and Gold Standard are hardly the only two examples possible. Many certifications and other similar organisations (e.g., reporting frameworks) have been expanding, collaborating, and merging with others toward similar goals. </p>
    <p>No need to take my word for it—Google it! </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rainforest Alliance and UTZ recently merged to increase combined coverage ahead of an agriculture and sustainability standard. The move accompanies Rainforest Alliance’s growing interest in becoming a supplier of ‘tailored supply chain’ services. </li>
      <li>The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) also recently merged into a new effort known as the Value Reporting Foundation. The goal is indeed a comprehensive reporting framework to help corporate actors report ESG performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>So what?</h2>

    <p>If all certifications transform into a framework for everything, what gives?</p>
    <p>The simple answer is that competition will become fiercer. Some of these new mega/meta certifications may prove stronger competitors than many competitors. This is interesting. </p>
    <p>The more complicated answer is that the situation may go well beyond mere competitive dynamics between private actors. As the examples above show, the new organisations want to support public and private actors in developing standards frameworks. They are in many ways laying out the very infrastructure for these frameworks. Implied is the question of who is currently leading who. This is also interesting.</p>
    <p>The even more complicated answer refers to the passing of time and how authority is conceived and operationalised at the systemic level. In the long-term, who are the ‘bigger’ sources of authority? The organisations that enshrine standards into law, or those developing and politely making said standards available. This is most interesting. </p>
    <p>Neither. Both. </p>
    <p>My hunch is that where public authority is robust, these will be a source of certainty and predictability. In these conditions, even these mega/meta-certifications will remain under the tutelage of public actors. However, where public authority is not robust, the new and improved certifications currently emerging may stand a chance to be recognised as the reliable authority. Should the latter places be much higher in number/salience than the former, the dynamic may call for revising how we conceive of public and private authority.</p>
    <p>Something like that—these are thoughts that will remain in development for a considerable while.</p>

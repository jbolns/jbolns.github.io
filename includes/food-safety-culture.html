    <p>All organisations, even informal ones, have a culture. Food businesses are not an exemption. Nothing new in and of itself. Many food businesses have always put effort into promoting a good culture amongst their staff. Incidents and accidents in the food sector have been linked to shortcomings in some businesses’ culture.</p>
    <p>The question, thus, is not whether culture is vital for food safety, but how.</p>
    <p>As food businesses become larger and more complex, diagnosing and, indeed, managing their culture gets harder. Without a clear systematic way to understand, measure, and manage food businesses' culture, even the best leaders may struggle to avoid incidents, accidents, and failures.</p>
    <p>There are two related needs: a need for tools to diagnose and manage food businesses' culture and a need to enable communication and mutual learning across all tools.</p>
    <h2>Communication and mutual learning</h2>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A holistic approach to food safety culture.<sup>1</sup></figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>Many good efforts are currently going into the first need, but the second need receives much less attention. This seems odd. Culture is highly situational and contextual. The best tool for a situation/context may not be ideal elsewhere. The future, thus, seems to call for a diversity of approaches and solutions.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I am interested in exploring ways for multiple approaches to food safety culture to co-exist and, indeed, support one another.</p>
    <p>As figure 1 (hover to enlarge) visualises, my research taught me that while food safety culture tools can be different, three concepts seem to underlie all or at least much thinking about food safety culture: systems, practices, and norms.</p>
    <p>I see a vehicle for communication and learning in this holistic view of food safety culture. I also believe that tools that ground themselves against a holistic view of food safety culture are likely to be more robust than those that do not – as the grounding may help to avoid a false sense of confidence and accidental oversights.</p>
    <h2>What I can do for you</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Help regulatory organisations think about their approach to food safety culture.</li>
      <li>Help other experts in food safety culture improve their tools.</li>
      <li>Help seemingly separate food safety culture efforts communicate and learn from one another.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All organisations have a culture. This culture influences how they go about their day-to-day operations.
      The question is not if an organisation’s culture influences how it contributes or fails to contribute to society and the environment,
      but how and whether improvement is possible.</p>

    <h2>Sound foundations</h2>
    <p>A necessary first step is to understand organisational culture.</p>
    <p>There are noteworthy approaches that may help us do this. For example, in
      <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/organisations-culture-food-safety.pdf" target="_blank">my work for the FSA</a>,
       I grounded myself on <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/edgar-h-schein" target="_blank">Schein</a>,
      <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/karl-weick" target="_blank">Weick</a>, and
      <a href="https://scholar-google-com.gate3.library.lse.ac.uk/citations?user=58wL0FsAAAAJ" target="_blank">Sackmann</a>.
      They offer a robust foundation to consider whenever thinking about organisational culture in any field of human activity.
      Additionally, while I personally have yet not implemented it,
      CARR's <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/accounting/carr/research/risk-culture-in-financial-organisations" target="_blank">Risk Culture</a> project
      identified factors one can use to understand risk taking and controls in the financial sector (and probably beyond).</p>
    <p>That said, a challenge that remains open is that even if the analysis of an organisation’s culture departs from a sound foundation,
      results will be but a snapshot of an organisation’s culture.</p>
    <p>An analogy used to explain organisational culture is the idea of an iceberg: you see the tip of the iceberg but not what is underneath.
      A way to partially go around this paradox is to add indicators to existing tools, which should be done and can bring improvement.</p>

    <h2>A Boolean approach</h2>
    <div class="enlarge">
      <img src="images/food-safety-culture.WebP" alt="A figure specifying three concepts that run underneath all or at least much thinking in organisational culture.">

    </div>

    <p>However, there is also a need to acknowledge one is but guaranteed to miss something.
      Assessing known organisational culture risks is essential, but there is also a need to be aware of potential unknowns.</p>
    <p>How can one see into what is not known, though? Increasingly adding questions/indicators to assessments seems problematic,
      as this may even harm an organisation’s culture by creating information overload problems.</p>
    <p>An alternative, however, is to gauge alignment between different aspects of an organisation’s culture.</p>
    <p>As figure 1 (hover to enlarge) visualises, I learned from my research that at the most general level,
      organisational culture can be conceived as the intersection of dynamics related to three concepts: systems, practices/behaviours, and norms.
      From this model’s perspective, a healthy organisational culture is only feasible if there is positive reinforcement/overlap between the three aspects.</p>
    <p>A hypothesis possible from the above is that even if one cannot see what is unknown,
      one may potentially gauge the effect of unknown organisational culture dynamics by testing alignment between what is known of said culture.
      If the data an organisation holds about itself shows positive feedbacks between the different aspects of organisational culture,
      the room for concern is minimal. If data shows tensions, unknown dynamics may be having harmful effects.
      Where no data exists about an aspect of an organisation’s culture and therefore assessment of feedbacks is non-viable,
      the room for concern is maximal.</p>

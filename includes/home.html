    <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting. I am a political economist with 5+ years of experience in policy analysis,
       2+ years in data-driven roles in the private sector, and extensive engagement with policymakers and stakeholders.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about understanding the interconnections between seemingly separate human phenomena.
      In my work, this translates into research/analysis about how <em>different</em> types
      of organisations tackle some of the trickiest policy/governance challenges of our days—the final goal being some sort of (fork-join) theory of
      how organisations as different as firms, certifications, and state regulators have a common-but-differentiated influence on said challenges.</p>
    <p>At the more practical level, I am the person you want when you need solutions for multi-dimensional
      policy/governance challenges involving many different actors.
      That is, of course, assuming you are willing to stick to the process of developing robust solutions.
      I do not believe in quick fixes.</p>
    <p>Check <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/Research/researcher-profiles/Jose-A-Bolanos" target="_blank">this profile</a> from my time at the LSE if you want to learn more about my approach to policy analysis.</p>

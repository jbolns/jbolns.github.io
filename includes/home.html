    <p>I was an academic for a bit, focused on sustainability, private governance, and the future of policy. I am now
    amongst probably-few political economists who can talk shop with programmers and data engineers.</p>

    <p>The transition was somewhat accidental. I took a few months after my last academic position to learn to code a little. Soon after, the universe forced me to simultaneously deal with my father’s loss and the birth of my first son. It was confusing to be so sad and so happy at the exact same time. I took refuge in spending time with my newborn son and continued coding. And I learned, and kept learning, and then learned more.</p>

    <p>I remain interested in intellectual debates. Knowledge is paramount. However, I am now also a more practical person
    who wants to solve problems rather than just talk about them.</p>

    <p>Hi! Thanks for paying me a visit. I am a political economist with 5+ years of experience in policy analysis,
       2+ years in data-driven roles in the private sector, extensive engagement with policymakers and stakeholders, and coding skills.</p>
    <p>In the broadest sense of things, I am passionate about understanding the interconnections between seemingly separate human phenomena.
      We are often too quick to dismiss causal effects that are not obvious or immediate, and this limits our understanding of the world. In my work,
      the underlying interest in understanding interconnections beyond the obvious translates into research/analysis about how <em>different</em> types
      of organisations tackle some of the most complex policy challenges they face. Over time, the goal is to increasingly connect best/worst practices across sectors (for techies, a fork-join approach to policy analysis).</p>
    <p>At the more practical level, speaking specifically about how we govern/regulate activities in/across public, private, and digital communities,
      I am the person you want when you need solutions for challenges with many dimensions (the kind that are difficult to even understand).
      That is, of course, assuming you are willing to stick to the process of developing robust solutions. I genuinely do not believe in quick fixes.</p>

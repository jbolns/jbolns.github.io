    <p>I am a data-savvy individual who is passionate about sustainability and believes in helping businesses operate successfully successfully in an increasingly polarised context where interest in the environment and society is rising.</p>
    <p>I was an academic for a bit, studying challenges related to sustainability, private governance, and the future of policy. I then learned to code in several languages and to use various data integration and business intelligence tools. I can therefore now <strong>help you think and act about sustainability and analytics</strong> in a strategically and technically sound manner that actually delivers tangible value.</p>
    <p>As an added bonus, I am a perspectivist. I am convinced that to truly understand anything, you must look at it from many different angles. This attitude has helped me develop the ability to use a broad range of tools and methods. What this means, in practice, is that I can adapt to your organisation and, with some exceptions, the processes and tools you already use. That is, of course, assuming you are willing to stick to the process of developing robust solutions. I believe in continuous improvement, not in quick fixes.</p>

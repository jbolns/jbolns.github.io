    <p>I am passionate about understanding the interconnections between seemingly separate human phenomena,
      which I believe is key to solving incredibly complex policy/governance challenges
       (including the design of standards and organisations to govern activities in public, private, or and/or hybrid communities).</p>
    <p>Additionally, I worked in resource planning/workforce management before graduate studies, which familiarised me with data and real-time analytics.</p>

    <p>All my projects have a scholarly and a practical side. At the scholarly level, the idea is to learn about how a variety of organisations from across environment and food sectors tackle their respective policy challenges – to then extract cross-sectoral lessons.</p>
    <p>At the practical level, this means ability to help public <em>and</em> private organisations to improve how they tackle pressing policy challenges.</p>

    <h1>Risk assessment in the context of the digital <span class="purple">platform economy</span></h1>
    <p>Risk assessment in the platform economy is bound to be difficult. A significant share of the activities in the platform economy are digital and therefore, hard to imagine/visualise. People often struggle to acknowledge that things they cannot fully visualise can have a massive effect on tangible things like a company’s profit, public health, or the environment.</p>
    <p>Difficult, however, does not mean impossible. Three steps can rapidly increase anyone’s ability to undertake risk assessment in (or of) the platform economy.<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Step #1—Identify risks</h2>
      <div class="enlarge">
        <img src="images/list-of-hazards.WebP" alt="Image of an example list of hazards.">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example list of hazards.</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>All risk assessment shares a need for identifying threats/hazards---thing that can go wrong. The platform economy is no different: online activities can go wrong in various manners.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a first step is to list things that are difficult to manage in the context of the platform economy.</p>
      <p>Comprehensiveness is unlikely, but even if not comprehensive, an initial set of concerns can act as a preliminary list of hazards to improve over time – figure 1 gives an example of one such list (click to enlarge).</p>

    <h2>Step #2—Traditional risk assessment</h2>
      <div class="enlarge">
        <img src="images/risk-assessment-cycle.WebP" alt="Image visualising a foundational risk assessment cycle.">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A foundational risk assessment cycle.</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>Not all concerns in a list of hazards will apply to all types of online actors. A next step is therefore selecting which hazards apply to which actors.</p>
      <p>Then comes the hard manual work that no one likes, which is to go one by one and estimate the likelihood of each applicable hazard realising into real-world events, the potential impact of one such event, the combined risk score, and how certain/uncertain you are in your estimates.</p>
      <p>Initial estimates will likely be inaccurate, but these can be improved cyclically—as visualised in figure 2 (click to enlarge).</p>

    <h2>Step #3—Configurational (life cycle) risk assessment</h2>
      <div class="enlarge">
        <img src="images/configurational-risk-assessment.WebP" alt="Image visualising a configurational risk assessment example for a single hazard.">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Configurational risk assessment example (single hazard).</figcaption>
      </div>

      <p>I believe you do not run before you can walk. For me, the previous steps are not optional. You master the basics; then you increase the sophistication of your assessment—never the other way around!</p>
      <p>That said, it is possible to move from the bare-knuckles risk assessment in the previous section to a more sophisticated understanding of how risks evolve in the context of the platform economy.</p>
      <p>How? Easy!</p>
      <p>For all applicable hazards, layout all possible states/scenarios and follow each hazard as a product/service makes its way through the different levels of the platform economy—as visualised in figure 3 (click to enlarge).</p>
      <p><strong><i>Note.</i></strong>Figure 3 offers and example for illustrative purposes and refers to a single hazard. There is a need to do this for each hazard from previous steps.</p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Some things you just think about until an idea makes itself available. This is what I am doing with this.</p>
      <p>That said, the tree-like nature of the last step should in theory be compatible with a game tree algorithm. My thinking on this matter may or may not be moving in that direction.</p>

    <p>Risk governance in the context of the platform economy is not necessarily impossible.
      Three steps can increase ability to undertake risk governance in/of the platform economy.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Step #1—Identify risks</h2>
      <div class="enlarge">
        <img src="images/list-of-hazards.WebP" alt="Image of an example list of hazards.">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example list of hazards.</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>All risk assessment shares a need for identifying threats/hazards—things that can go wrong. The platform economy is no different: online activities can go wrong in various manners.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the first step is to list things that are difficult to manage in the context of the platform economy and may lead to public harms—figure 1 gives an example (hover to enlarge).</p>
      <p>Comprehensiveness is unlikely, but even if not comprehensive, the concerns identified can act as a preliminary list of hazards to improve over time.</p>
    <h2>Step #2—Traditional risk assessment</h2>
      <div class="enlarge">
        <img src="images/risk-assessment-cycle.WebP" alt="Image visualising a foundational risk assessment cycle.">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A foundational risk assessment cycle.</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>Not all concerns in a list of hazards will apply to all types of online actors.</p>
      <p>A next step is therefore selecting which hazards apply to which actors (if you need to assess many different types of actors) or to you (if you are interested in improving the governance of activities in your platform).</p>
      <p>The next step is to begin assessing risk by estimating the likelihood of incidents/accidents arising from each applicable hazard, the potential impact of one such event, the combined risk score, and how uncertainty your estimates are.</p>
      <p>Initial estimates will likely be inaccurate, but continuous/cyclical improvement is possible—as visualised in figure 2 (hover to enlarge).</p>
    <h2>Step #3—Configurational (life cycle) risk assessment</h2>
      <div class="enlarge">
        <img src="images/configurational-risk-assessment.WebP" alt="Image visualising a configurational risk assessment example for a single hazard.">
        <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Configurational risk assessment example (single hazard).</figcaption>
      </div>
      <p>I am one of those who believes you do not run before you can walk. For me, the approach in the previous section is not optional. You master the basics; then you increase the sophistication of your assessment—never upside down!</p>
      <p>That said, it is possible to move from the bare-knuckles risk assessment in the previous section to a more sophisticated understanding of how risks evolve in the context of the platform economy.</p>
      <p>How? Easy! For all applicable hazards,map out all possible states/scenarios and follow each hazard as a product/service makes its way through the different levels of the platform economy—as figure 3 exemplifies (hover to enlarge).</p>

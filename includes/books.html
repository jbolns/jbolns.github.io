    <p>I sometimes read. I like to read, but I'm also lazy so I sometimes do not read. My favourite modern author is that author. My favourite classical author is that other author. My favourite book, funny enough, is from neither of these two authors. Instead, my favourite book is that other book.</p>
    <p>Below some pictures of books. No relation whatsoever with the books I read. I just think they're pretty</p>

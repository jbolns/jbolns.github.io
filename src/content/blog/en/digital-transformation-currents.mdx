The most general drivers of the digital transformation are companies' and organisations' need for **integrating** information from across an ever-increasing number of areas and activities, **responding** to users', customers', and stakeholders' preferences and expectations, and acting in increasingly **accelerated** manners.

## Transformational currents
Other lower-level drivers exist.[^1] However, these three needs seem to be influencing how **all** organisations approach the digital transformation.

They are always present. Like oceanic currents.

### Integration[^2]
Organisations are increasingly aware of the negative effects of having data siloed across different levels of an organisation, industry, or sector. Additionally, digital interconnectedness is on the rise alongside the need to operate digitally and enable interactions across regions and between organisations. Furthermore, numerous organisations are now interested in measuring the social and environmental impacts of business activities, which requires assembling very different kinds of data.

As a result, organisations now need to find and integrate increasingly large sets of data, of different types, and from an increasingly broader range of sources.

### Responsiveness[^3]
Interest in personalised solutions tailored to the needs of individual users is on the rise. Additionally, transparency demands are shifting from general-level expectations to a desire for granular data. All the while, the world is becoming increasingly polarised, which means pressure to respond to stakeholder demands is also rising.

As a result, organisations must at least partially use any data they gather to understand and respond to consumers', citizens', and stakeholders' expectations.

### Acceleration[^4]
The speed of human interaction has increased steadily, with many interactions now taking place in the span of seconds. Additionally, inter-sectoral effects are now faster than ever, and example how COVID's impact on supply chains was almost immediate. Not to mention the technology sector itself is characterised by a “break things fast” mentality that explicitly calls for organisations to act and develop speedily.

As a result, organisations now face a need to be increasingly quicker about everything, operate with timely data, and be "agile" in their own development.

## Awareness pays
Digital transformation projects in any organisation will be influenced by these three transformational currents independently of whether implementers are aware of them or not.

Implementers unaware of these three transformational currents are like sailors trying to navigate the sea without understanding how oceanic currents work.

Implementers aware of the transformational currents do not have success guaranteed, but they do benefit of the ability to make informed choices.

Global governance needs a re-assessment in light of several recent electoral events worldwide, including, but not limited to, Trump's victory.

The reassessment cannot be superficial. This is especially true in sustainability and technology, two fields strongly affected by recent political events.

Among what needs to be revised is the role of voluntary governance, which should be brought forward.

## Micro-summary of the current (flawed) understanding of voluntary governance
Many governance experts see voluntary governance as fundamentally inferior to state-led governance/policy/regulation.

In their view, voluntary governance is highly imperfect.

This has hampered engagement with voluntary governance:
- In sustainability, for instance, many want (wanted?) to implement Paris in a way that limits room for meaningful action by voluntary mechanisms.
- In AI policy, the sole mention of voluntary governance mechanisms is enough to ignite the ire of some AI ethicists.

## A more helpful understanding of voluntary governance
Yet, my point is and has always been that while similarities exist, voluntary governance is teleologically different (i.e. best suited for different purposes) to state-driven governance/policy/regulation.

Voluntary governance can successfully perform three roles:
- **Help lower the complexity of policies.** If you use voluntary governance to solve some problems, you have fewer problems to address with policy, and policies can end up being less complex. 
- **Create processes and capacities that would otherwise not exist.** One of the trademarks of voluntary governance is the ability to freely look for opportunities and figure out innovative solutions to open challenges. 
- **Enable better rewards for those wanting to go the extra mile.** Voluntary governance mechanisms cannot ensure *all* products are better, only that *some* are. In other words, one should measure voluntary governance against its capacity to motivate some actors to think innovatively produce better products, which is what might, over time, help solve problems generally.

Alas, this potential is not currently being fully exploited. For instance...
- **Anti-example 1.** The EU's digital and AI regulations are an enormous collection of complex and fragmented rules partly because they attempted to regulate "horizontally" without first trying to use voluntary mechanisms to reduce the complexity of the challenge. We might never know if private actors could have come up with fundamentally novel solutions to the problems some EU laws only address imperfectly.
- **Anti-example 2.** Many environmentalists are increasingly judging voluntary mechanisms with the same bar one would measure state-driven efforts, rather than on their ability to catalyze innovative thinking by exceptional actors. In my view, this hampers innovation by forcing voluntary governance actors to behave overcautiosly.

## And what about "hard" policies/regulations?
This article is exclusively about private governance. It is not about the entire system. Laws can indeed be necessary on ocassion. 

Having said that, I disagree with those who view global governance as primarily about making laws/regulations at a global level. One cannot forget that we should strive to govern ourselves in ways that everyone can live with. Voluntary governance may not be the favourite of hardcore leftist ideologes, but it is compatible with thinking across ideological camps.

Thus, whenever a choice is available, voluntary governance should be preferred.

## But what about Trump?
Yeah, what about him? 

Voluntary governance is compatible with thinking across ideological camps.

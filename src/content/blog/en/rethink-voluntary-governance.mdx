Global governance needs a re-assessment in light of several recent electoral events worldwide, including but not limited to Trump's victory. This is especially true in sustainability and technology, two fields strongly affected by recent political events.

The role of voluntary governance is amongst the things that need to be re-assessed: it must be brought forward.

## Regulation is not a goal in itself
I spent many years studying and contributing to the betterment of regulation.

Regulation is a tool one sometimes needs to use, not a goal in itself.

Unfortunately, many seem increasingly willing to support any regulation, good or bad, just because it is regulation.

## Voluntary governance mechanisms are ideologically disliked
The cult of regulation has strengthened ideological dislike of voluntary governance. A field where this happens in plain sight is technology governance, where even mentioning the words “self-regulation” can ignite the ire of some.

One needs to call this for what it is: ideological bias.

Voluntary governance is imperfect, but whatever you can solve with it, you don't need to solve with hard policies.

## A change is needed nonetheless
In any case, it might not matter much anymore if you like or dislike voluntary governance.

The current US administration is unlikely to support regulation-driven global governance efforts (truth be said, they are unlikely to support any global governance efforts, but voluntary mechanisms are harder to oppose politically).

Will things change after Trump leaves office?

I do not know. As things currently stand, whoever he anoints would wipe the floor with the Democratic establishment.

This might change, indeed, but things in the US would need to go spectacularly bad for Trump for this change to be sufficient to swing the pendulum back fully.

Without one such change, the world will remain fragmented. In such conditions, the current approach to global governance can, at best, offer what we currently see: periods of over-regulation followed by periods of complete reversal of anything agreed upon, e.g., Trump leaving the Paris Agreement for the **second** time.

Two steps in one direction. Two steps in the opposite direction. How is this good governance?

We should work towards robust global governance.

Voluntary governance seems a necessary component of a robust global governance system because it is compatible with views across the ideological spectrum.

## Different, not inferior
Not to say voluntary governance is perfect. 

Not at all. It is possible to be quite critical of it, indeed.

For this reason, ideological detractors have succeeded in hampering interest in even fields once characterised by significant voluntary governance. For instance, despite contributing enormously to keeping efforts alive and developing new techniques in areas such as carbon offsetting, sustainability certifications are now regularly attacked for failing to avoid mistakes.

This is why my point is, and has always been, that the pragmatic thing to do is to focus on what voluntary governance can do (rather than what it cannot).

In particular, voluntary governance can be pretty successful in three ways:
- **Toyota-effect.** Many hugely successful voluntary mechanisms are what I dub “Toyota” certifications: baseline standards that are affordable enough for many actors to adopt. They are not particularly luxurious, but they are outstandingly flexible and robust.
- **Ferrari-effect.** Another type of voluntary mechanism that tends to do well is what I call "Ferrari" certifications: niche labels that help some actors charge A LOT more for their products than their competitors. They cannot ensure *all* products are better, but they motivate *some* actors to be more innovative than they otherwise could.
- **Capacity generation.** As voluntary governance mechanisms develop (a process that is partly described by efforts to try and become Ferrari-Toyota certifications – but that is a matter for a different post), they can help create new processes/resources that help other actors do things better. **NOT** to say voluntary governance will help all actors in all ways needed. It does mean, however, that it can help create the capacity for others to rely upon (including governments: some highly successful voluntary bodies now help governments do things better – but this is also a matter for a separate post).

## And what about "hard" policies, aka. regulations?
This article is exclusively about private governance, not about the entire system of global governance.

I would not profess to be able to solve the world problems with voluntary governance alone. 

Laws are often necessary.

However, the opposite is also true. The world's problems cannot be solved without strong voluntary governance efforts of varied and many different kinds.

The way I see it, thus, is that it is fine if you are not in love with voluntary governance, as long as your ideology does not prevent you from acknowledging the need for it.

## But what about Trump?
Yeah, what about him?

Voluntary governance is compatible with thinking across ideological camps, including a large number of right-wing voters.

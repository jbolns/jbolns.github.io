I provided expert research/analytical support to the analytics unit of a large regulatory agency in the UK. In this time, I delivered three projects as lead researcher (including data-driven network mapping and the development of a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool for analysis of public health and trust risks in the digital economy / digital platforms) and actively contributed to several other projects.

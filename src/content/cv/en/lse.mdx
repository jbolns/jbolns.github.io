I was placed in the analytics unit of a large regulatory agency in the UK where I used academic expertise to support policymaking. Projects included data-driven network mapping and risk assessment in the digital economy.

In this position, I had the opportunity to...
-	complete analytics projects using different methods, including qualitative and data-driven analyses
-	collaboratively deliver recommendations with colleagues across different teams
-	and present findings to stakeholders from across public, private, and academic sectors.

I was the lead researcher in a project about long-term environmental, social, and political/governance (ESG) risks likely to influence the future of the oil industry – funded by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS).

Key achievements for this position include...
-	designing, implementing, and delivering the project on time and within budget
-	making predictions that have, for the most, held (exception made of short-lived COVID-related price changes)
-	and contributing to organising four seminars related to the fellowship’s topic.

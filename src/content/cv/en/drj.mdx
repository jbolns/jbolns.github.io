I develop resources addressing key digital sustainability/ethics challenges and offer services in related areas.

Thus far, my favourite projects in this position have been...
- a sustainable Gatsby-React website running on an automated GitHub-AWS CI/CD pipeline
- a Python-JS tool to produce sustainable websites directly from documents (like Word documents)
-	a Python app to easily undertake AI transcriptions privately on personal computers.

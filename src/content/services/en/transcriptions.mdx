Online AI transcriptions services are helpful, but sometimes there is a need to keep data "close to heart" and perform AI transcriptions locally on your own equipment/infrastructure.

**The risks are significant.** These days, [a few seconds of audio data is enough to create an audio-deepfake](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/). Additionally, some conversations (e.g. interviews, medical conversations, etc.) can contain information you may not want to accidentally end up sharing with others.

## Hire me!
I can help you transcribe audio directly on your computer, without a need to send the audios to external providers.

I maintain an open source edge-AI transcription App that you can easily install and use on your own computer. It's called LOKAL and you can read more about it [here](../portfolio/en/lokal/). I can also help you implement AI transcriptions as part of your own infrastructure/system. 

Check out some of the available options below and get in touch to discuss possibilities!

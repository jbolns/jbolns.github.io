Choosing a sustainable host/cloud is key to minimise your digital footprint.

I can advice and support you in implementing hosting/cloud solutions in way that reduces your environmental impact. This includes guidance on selecting energy-efficient providers, optimising your cloud usage, and exploring options powered by renewable energy sources.

You'll not only lower your carbon emissions but can also often benefit desde reduced running costs and enhance your brand's green credentials.

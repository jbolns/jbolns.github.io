Software built using a Build-Transfer (BT) or Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) approach offers flexibility for those who like planned transitions.

With a BT model, the software is built to your specifications and then handed over to your team. A BOT approach includes an initial period of operation before the transfer. Both models allow you to leverage external expertise for development and early testing, while ensuring control and ownership of the final product.

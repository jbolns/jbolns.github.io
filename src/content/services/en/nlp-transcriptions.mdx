On-premise AI transcriptions are a powerful alternative for companies and organisations that need transcriptions but either do not want or cannot rely on external services due to privacy and compliance risks.

I provide strategic advice and coding support to help you implement local AI transcription tools seamlessly into your existing workflow. This allows you to perform transcriptions directly on your own systems, ensuring maximum data privacy and security.

Not all websites are born equal! 

**People care about website looks.** They say they don't, but they do. Your website has about [50 milliseconds (0.05 seconds!) to make a good impression](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290500330448). And a whooping [83% per cent of people appreciate when websites look attractive and up to date](https://clutch.co/resources/top-6-website-features-people-value#people-want-to-limit-their-time-online-which-requires-more-engaging-websites).

**Performance matters!** Google says so: [more than 50% of users abandon websites that take too long to load](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/mobile-site-load-time-statistics/). Every second counts for [user experience](https://unbounce.com/page-speed-report/), [conversion rates](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/), and [SEO rankings](https://www.edgeoftheweb.co.uk/blog/importance-of-page-speed).

## Hire me!
I can build you and/or help your team build a website that is, all, fast, beautiful, and sustainable.

To ensure the result is what you need, I don't even charge by the hour. Instead, I give you a price for the project and we go at that website until you are completely satisfied.[^1]

I am also happy to offer you coding in any of the following stacks.

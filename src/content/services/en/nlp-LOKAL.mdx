The risks of sharing audios are significant. These days, [a few seconds of audio data is enough to create an audio-deepfake](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/). Additionally, some audios such as those coming from interviews, medical conversations, and personal conversations can contain very sensitive information.

Why risk it, if there's no need?

I maintain an open source edge-AI transcription App that you can easily install and use on your own computer.

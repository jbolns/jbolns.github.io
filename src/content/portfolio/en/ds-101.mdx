A course syllabus for an introductory mini-course to digital sustainability suitable for students, managers, policymakers, and even programmers. Available via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/ds_101).

The course can be implemented as given, expanded, or condensed.

## Summary
The course emphasises the connection between doing digital things sustainably and the ability to save and/or make money from it.

A challenge with sustainability is the preconception that sustainability hurts the financial bottom line. This is NOT the case with digital sustainability. At the moment, actions that reduce the footprint of digital activities can also enable significant money savings. Additionally, there is market demand for sustainable products and services.

This course syllabus aims to motivate sustainability actions by emphasising its benefits on both the environmental and monetary fronts.

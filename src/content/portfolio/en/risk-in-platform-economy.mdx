I developed a proof-of-concept tool to demonstrate that it is possible to assess public health and integrity risks of/by digital platforms.

The tool has a self-assesment module for platforms and an assesment module for auditors/regulators—a self-regulation/oversight cycle.

## Rationale
The development of this tool was part of a research project for the UK's Food Standard's Agency (FSA).

The broader project sought to determine if existing FSA resources be joined into a tool to assess food safety and integrity risks in the context of the platform economy.

The broader project found that, with a little help, existing FSA resources can be joined into two types of tools:
- A self-assessment tool to assist/guide online food vendors and intermediary platforms in gauging food safety and integrity risks – feasible in the short-term
- An assessment tool for use in external audits/inspections by qualified auditors and/or enforcement personnel – feasible in the long-term.

Preliminary *proof of concept* versions of these tools were delivered alongside the research documents.

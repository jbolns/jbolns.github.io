This project used internal data about the activities of a regulatory agency in the UK to map its international network. The map was then used as part of recommendations related to the Agency's international strategy.

The mapped-outputs of this project were meant for internal use by the Agency and can therefore not be shared. A shareable overview of the project is available on request.

The project used Gephi for data mapping. Very nice graphics!

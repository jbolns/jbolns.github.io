A set of VBA scripts to rapidly produce supervised ML analyses in Excel.

Scripts available via [GitHub](https://github.com/jbolns/atheoretical).

## ML in Excel? Why would anyone do that?!

This project is mainly meant as a demonstration of skills and potentially a stepping stone for future versions.

That said, say you have clean data already available in Excel, this is the kind of solution you would need to periodically run supervised ML in Excel.

Early stage. Expect bugs.

## Usage/Licensing
I really do not think the files are yet at production or even pilot-testing level.

Truth be said, the VBA/Excel approach is intended as a conceptual foundation for something more Pythonic.

So, for now, let's say it's all rights reserved.

<p>By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4 id="collecting-and-using-your-personal-data">Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h4>
<p>The Service does not currently gather any data about You. That said, the Company reserves the right to ask You for this information.</p>
<h4 id="cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies">Cookies and other tracking technologies</h4>
<p>Cookies are not currently directly used in the Service.</p>
<p>Third-party cookies may be required to deliver embedded content. However, this is not automatic and you would be asked consent if/when needed.</p>
<p>The Service has a “dark mode” functionality that requires storing a small bit of data to your browser’s “session storage”. The data does not include any kind of tracking technology. Additionally, the data is stored to “session storage” specifically because browsers remove any data stored to “session storage” automatically when you terminate the session (e.g. close the tab).</p>
<h4 id="gdpr-privacy-policy">GDPR Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>While the Service does not currently process any data about you, the Company maintains the right to do so in the future.</p>
<p>In such case, the Company may process Personal Data under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consent: You have given Your consent for processing Personal Data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
<li>Performance of a contract: Provision of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with You and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
<li>Legal obligations: Processing Personal Data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Company is subject.</li>
<li>Vital interests: Processing Personal Data is necessary in order to protect Your vital interests or of another natural person.</li>
<li>Public interests: Processing Personal Data is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Company.</li>
<li>Legitimate interests: Processing Personal Data is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the Company will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
<p><em>Your Rights under the GDPR</em></p>
<p>The Company undertakes to respect the confidentiality of Your Personal Data and to guarantee You can exercise Your rights.</p>
<p>You have the right under this Privacy Policy, and by law if You are within the EU, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to Your Personal Data. The right to access, update or delete the information the Company has on You.

<li>Request correction of the Personal Data that Company holds about You. You have the right to have any incomplete or inaccurate information the Company holds about You corrected.</li>
<li>Object to processing of Your Personal Data. This right exists where the Company is relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing and there is something about Your particular situation, which makes You want to object to the Service’s processing of Your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the right to object where Your Personal Data is processed for direct marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Request erasure of Your Personal Data. You have the right to ask the deletion or removal of Personal Data when there is no good reason for the Company to continue processing it.</li>
<li>Request the transfer of Your Personal Data. The Service will provide to You, or to a third party You have chosen, Your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which You initially provided consent for the Company to use or where the Company used the information to perform a contract with You.</li>
<li>Withdraw Your consent. You have the right to withdraw Your consent on using your Personal Data. If You withdraw Your consent, the Company may not be able to provide You with access to certain specific functionalities of the Service.</li>
</ul>

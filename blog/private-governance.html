    <h2>Some thoughts about the future of <span class='purple'>sustainability certifications</span> and, more generally,
      private authority</h2>
    <p>Sustainability certifications no longer want to be certifications, not as traditionally conceived, anyway. Instead,
      many are evolving into broader frameworks to support the design of corporate, regional, and national
      governance/regulation.</p>

    <h3>Examples of transformation</h3>
    <p>My favourite examples are the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Gold Standard, two pioneer voluntary carbon
      offset certifications. Both organisations were prototypical certifications: standards, audit, label, done!
      However, they recently transformed significantly.</p>
    <p>VCS became Verra, an organisation that “develops and manages standards that are globally applicable and advance
      action across a wide range of sectors and activities”.<sup>1</sup> Verra now has several frameworks in addition to
      its original carbon offset certification programme, and some push the envelope of what it means to be a
      certification. Verra’s Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+ (JNR) aims to help national and subnational actors develop
      jurisdictional rules.<sup>2</sup> Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard is part of a broader effort known as
      the 3R Initiative (3RI).<sup>3</sup> 3RI is a collaboration by civil society and private sector organisations that
      aims “to jointly develop an innovative and flexible mechanism to scale-up plastic waste recovery and recycling
      while making a sustainable social impact”.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>Gold Standard is now an umbrella framework for “creating robust standards for climate and development
      interventions”,<sup>5</sup> the overarching goal being to support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
      from different angles. With the support of the Germany Ministry of the Environment, the new organisation is
      working towards “a framework to transition the voluntary carbon market for alignment with new rules emerging from
      the Paris Agreement”.<sup>6</sup> Also, the new Gold Standard has a supply chain effort known as ValueChange,
      which aims to help corporate actors “reduce emissions in their value chains and to credibly report on these
      outcomes in line with best-practice accounting and reporting framework such as the GHG Protocol and Science-Based
      Targets”.<sup>7</sup></p>

    <h3>The extent of transformation</h3>
    <p>Verra and Gold Standard are hardly the only examples. Many certifications and similar organisations like
      reporting frameworks have been expanding, collaborating, and merging with others toward similar goals.</p>
    <p>No need to take my word for it—Google it! </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rainforest Alliance and UTZ recently merged to increase combined coverage ahead of an agriculture and
        sustainability standard. The move accompanies Rainforest Alliance’s growing interest in becoming a supplier of
        ‘tailored supply chain’ services. </li>
      <li>The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)
        also recently merged into a new effort known as the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF). The goal was a
        comprehensive reporting framework to help corporate actors report ESG performance. The VRF then went on to
        consolidate further and is now part of the newly established International Sustainability Standards Board
        (ISSB), itself part of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) Foundation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>So what?</h3>

    <p>If all certifications transform into a framework for everything, what gives?</p>
    <p>The simple answer is that competitive dynamics in certification spaces may change. Some of the new
      meta-certifications may prove stronger than competitors. This is interesting.</p>
    <p>A more complicated answer is that the situation may also involve increased cooperation across public and private
      domains. As noted above, the new organisations want to support public and private actors in developing standards
      frameworks. Implied is the question of who leads who. This is also interesting.</p>
    <p>The even more complicated answer relates to how authority is distributed at the systemic level. In the long-term,
      who are the ‘bigger’ sources of authority, especially in the context of sustainability? The public bodies that
      enshrine standards into law, or the private organisations developing and making said standards. This is most
      interesting. </p>
    <p>My hunch is that where public authority is robust, this new type of meta-certifications will remain under the
      tutelage of public actors. However, where public authority is weak or disorganised, the new kind of certifications
      currently emerging may stand a chance to be recognised as the reliable authority. Should the latter places be much
      higher in number than the former, the dynamic may call for revising how we conceive of public and private
      authority.</p>

    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>Something like that—these are thoughts that will remain in development for a considerable while.</p>

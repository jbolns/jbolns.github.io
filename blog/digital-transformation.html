    <h3>Integration, responsiveness, and acceleration</h3>

    </div>

    <p>While lower-level drivers, themes, technologies, and actor types exist and deserve separate mention,<sup>1</sup>
      three strategic needs that seem to be influencing how <u>all</u> organisations are approaching the digital
      transformation are [the need for] <strong>integration</strong>, <strong>responsiveness</strong>, and
      <strong>acceleration</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>This seems true generally, but is especially visible in the context of sustainability. Organisations of all types
      regularly struggle to gather the broad range of data needed to make sense of their environmental impacts, consider
      a
      wide variety of customer and market preferences, and analyse everything as fast as is needed to act in a timely
      manner.</p>

    <div class='third'>
      <strong>Integration</strong><sup>2</sup>
      <p>The negative effects of having data siloed across different levels of an organisation, industry, or sector are
        being increasingly acknowledged. Digital interconnectedness is also on the rise and, with it, the need to
        operate
        digitally and enable interactions across regions and between organisations. Interest in the impacts of business
        activities is increasing, which requires considering data of/from very different types/sources.</p>
      <p>As a result of these and similar dynamics, organisations now need to find and integrate increasingly large sets
        of data, of different types, and from an increasingly broader range of sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class='third'>
      <strong>Responsiveness</strong><sup>3</sup>
      <p>Interest in personalised or tailored solutions that adapt and respond to the needs of individual customers or
        citizens is on the rise. Transparency expectations are shifting from general-level expectations to scalability
        (the ability to zoom in and out of a process or supply chain). All this is happening in a context that is
        increasingly political, and where even hypothetical events can trigger heavy criticism.</p>
      <p>As a result, organisations must now balance the need for data to understand and respond to consumers, citizens,
        and stakeholders and the risks of gathering and holding said data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class='third'>
      <strong>Acceleration</strong><sup>4</sup>
      <p>The speed of human interaction has increased steadily in recent times, with many interactions now taking place
        in
        the span of seconds. Even physical issues spread nowadays incredibly fast. For instance, COVID affected supply
        chains almost immediately. Finally, many sectors these days are dominated by a “break things fast” mentality
        that
        pushes actors to develop as fast as possible, which carries a huge risk of omissions.</p>
      <p>As a result of these and similar dynamics, organisations now face a need to be increasingly quicker, operate
        with
        timely data, and approach development in agile (or downright Agile) manners.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Transformational currents</h3>
    <p>These drivers are like oceanic currents: they touch everything in the sea, even if their final effect varies
      after
      context. In any given circumstance, a digital transformation strategy will be influenced by <u>all</u> three
      currents.</p>
    <p>Efforts consciously aware of the three currents will aim for balance. For instance, they will, among other
      things,
      manage the need to integrate data about very different types of environmental impacts in a way that matches the
      needs of their customers and does not incur excessive delays or computational costs.</p>
    <p>Efforts not consciously aware of the currents will likely still pursue the goals implied in at least one of the
      currents and be challenged/surprised by events relating to the other currents. For instance, an organisation
      obsessed with gathering data can easily forget about the time and money needed to manage all that data, or the
      significant reputational and regulatory risks implied in an agenda driven by a mere thirst for data.</p>


    <h3>Key to success, but not sufficient</h3>
    <p>Learning how to make the most of synergies and minimise potential conflicts across the three transformational
      currents described above is vital for success, especially in the context of sustainability.</p>
    <p>Not to say that understanding the currents guarantees success. It is indeed important to consider other aspects
      of
      the digital transformation, such as enabling technologies, competitors' strategies, stakeholder interests, your
      own
      organisational culture, and so forth.</p>
    <p>However, understanding the transformational currents and their effect on a given digital transformation strategy
      does seem necessary. Lacking such understanding would be equivalent to trying to navigate the sea without
      understanding how oceanic currents <i>will</i> affect the journey.</p>

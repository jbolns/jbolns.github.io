<h2>Managing a technology, <span class='purple'>nurturing</span> (artificial) intelligence</h2>
<p>Technologies need management. Intelligence needs nurturing. Artificial intelligence (AI) is both a technology and, although currently very limited, a form of intelligence. Can AI be both managed and nurtured at once?</p>

<h3>AI as technology</h3>
<p>We commonly use the word technology to refer to machine-like things. However, the concept of technology refers not to physical devices themselves but to the systematic application of scientific knowledge and resources for practical ends, i.e., to achieve things.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>We associate technology with machines and the like because physical devices are needed to apply scientific knowledge systematically â€“ it takes a plane to conquer gravity type-of-thing.</p>
<p>AI is not a technology simply because it comes from a machine. AI is a system of fancy statistical calculations. Scientific knowledge applied systematically. It just so happens that we need computers to perform the fancy calculations now called AI.</p>
<p>In this sense, AI will always be a technology. Even if the future brings humanoid AIs that think like humans, these would still systematically apply scientific knowledge and resources to achieve practical outcomes.</p>

<h3>AI as proper intelligence</h3>
<p>Human intelligence is also, in a way, a type of technology. An organic form of technology that precedes science. A less scientific machine-enabled technology, if one needs to emphasise the human/machine dichotomy.</p>
<p>Yet, while our brains result from biology and evolution (or divine intervention â€“ this makes no difference to this argument) rather than science, we also systematically apply knowledge (which may be biological or, upon learning sciences, scientific) and resources (which may be biological or, upon learning to use machines, artificial) for practical ends.</p>
<p>In this sense, AI ought to be considered proper intelligence rather than mimicry of intelligence.</p>
<p>Perhaps the intelligence from machines is a lower form of intelligence than that produced by human brains â€“ yet to be seen. It also seems the case that the intelligence of machines is potentially a different, more calculative rather than intuitive, type of intelligence.</p>
<p>Yet, it is knowledge and resources systematically applied in pursuit of practical outcomes. </p>
<p>Proper intelligence.</p>

<h3>Manage and nurture</h3>
<p>When you have a purely mechanical technology, management comes down to delineating desirable and undesirable outcomes. Pursue the former. Avoid the latter.</p>
<p>It works differently with intelligence.</p>
<p>When we think of intelligence, we usually want to nurture it, i.e., let it grow so it can make better decisions. We also typically accept the need for mistakes.</p>
<p>Yet, if AI is technology but also, at the same time, intelligence in the proper sense of the word, both things are needed.</p>

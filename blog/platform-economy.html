    <h2>Risk assessment in the <span class='purple'>platform economy</span></h2>
    <p>Risk assessment in the platform economy is bound to be difficult. Difficult, however, does not mean impossible.
      Three steps can rapidly increase anyone’s ability to undertake risk assessments in the context of the platform
      economy.</p>

    <h3>Step #1—Identify risks</h3>
    <div class='blogimage'>
      <img src='images/list-of-hazards.WebP' alt='Image of an example list of hazards.'>
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Example list of hazards.</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>All risk assessment shares a need for identifying threats/hazards---thing that can go wrong. The platform economy
      is no different: online activities can go wrong in various manners.</p>
    <p>Therefore, a first step is to list things that are difficult to manage in the context of the platform economy.
    </p>
    <p>Comprehensiveness is unlikely, but even if not comprehensive, an initial set of concerns can act as a preliminary
      list of hazards to improve over time – figure 1 gives an example of one such list (hover to enlarge).</p>

    <h3>Step #2—Traditional risk assessment</h3>
    <div class='blogimage'>
      <img src='images/risk-assessment-cycle.WebP' alt='Image visualising a foundational risk assessment cycle.'>
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> A foundational risk assessment cycle.</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>Not all concerns in a list of hazards will apply to all types of online actors. A next step is therefore
      selecting
      which hazards apply to which actors.</p>
    <p>Then comes the hard manual work that no one likes, which is to go one by one and estimate the likelihood of each
      applicable hazard realising into real-world events, the potential impact of one such event, the combined risk
      score,
      and how certain/uncertain you are in your estimates.</p>
    <p>Initial estimates will likely be inaccurate, but these can be improved cyclically—as visualised in figure 2
      (hover to enlarge).</p>

    <h3>Step #3—Configurational (life cycle) risk assessment</h3>
    <div class='blogimage'>
      <img src='images/configurational-risk-assessment.WebP'
        alt='Image visualising a configurational risk assessment example for a single hazard.'>
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Configurational risk assessment example (single hazard).</figcaption>
    </div>

    <p>I believe you do not run before you can walk. For me, the previous steps are not optional. You master the basics;
      then you increase the sophistication of your assessment—never the other way around!</p>
    <p>That said, it is possible to move from the bare-knuckles risk assessment in the previous section to a more
      sophisticated understanding of how risks evolve in the context of the platform economy.</p>
    <p>How? Easy!</p>
    <p>For all applicable hazards, layout all possible states/scenarios and follow each hazard as a product/service
      makes
      its way through the different levels of the platform economy—as visualised in figure 3 (hover to enlarge).</p>
    <p><strong><i>Note.</i></strong>Figure 3 offers and example for illustrative purposes and refers to a single hazard.
      There is a need to do this for each hazard from previous steps.</p>

    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>Some things you just think about until an idea makes itself available. This is what I am doing with this.</p>
    <p>That said, the tree-like nature of the last step should in theory be compatible with a game tree algorithm. My
      thinking on this matter may or may not be moving in that direction.</p>

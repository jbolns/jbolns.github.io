<h2>Measuring unknown unknowns in <span class='purple'>organisational culture</span></h2>
<p>All organisations have a culture, which influences how they go about their activities. The question is therefore not if an organisation’s culture influences its performance, but, rather, whether improvement is possible, and to what extent.</p>
<h3>Sound foundations</h3>
<p>A necessary first step to thinking about the culture of an organisation is visualising it and, to the extent possible, measure it. </p>
<p>There are noteworthy approaches that help in this. Three foundational references are <a href='https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/edgar-h-schein' target='_blank'>Schein</a>, <a href='https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/karl-weick' target='_blank'>Weick</a>, and <a href='https://scholar-google-com.gate3.library.lse.ac.uk/citations?user=58wL0FsAAAAJ' target='_blank'>Sackmann</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Schein is famously linked to the idea that organisational culture has visible (artefacts), declared (espoused values), and invisible (underlying beliefs) aspects—the latter being incredibly hard to measure.</li>
<li>Weick is key to understanding that individuals need to continuously make sense of an organisation’s culture (or, rather, that organisational culture is a dynamic construct), which is why even relatively sound organisational cultures can fail in the face of unexpected adversity. </li>
<li>Sackmann helpfully highlighted that the culture of an organisation is not unitary but, rather, an often-fragmented amalgam of subcultures across various organisational levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many, many authors have developed improved frameworks furthering one or more of these propositions.</p>
<h3>A crucial paradox</h3>
<p>Yet, regardless of how one approaches it, any assessment of the culture of an organisation will yield but a snapshot of an organisation’s culture. Something will be missed. You can count on it.</p>
<p>The limitation is inescapable. If someone claims to be able to assess the entirety of an organisation’s culture without missing anything important, that someone is not sufficiently an expert in the topic.</p>
<p>The limitation is also a bit of a paradox. Organisational culture failures may result from unknown things and unexpected events, but assessments of organisational culture are guaranteed to miss something.</p>
<p>In other words, what an assessment misses today may cause an incident/accident tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Current solutions and a remaining challenge</h3>
<p>An obvious way to ameliorate the problem is to try and miss the least possible. The more one can measure, the more one can manage directly.</p>
<p>There is some promise in efforts in this direction, especially in an age of continuously improving data analysis. However, there is also a need to stop somewhere. At some point or another, the assessment will become an unreasonable burden.</p>
<p>Then comes the fun bit, namely, developing mechanisms to flag potential unknown unknowns.</p>
<h3>Boolean improvement</h3>
<p><img alt="A figure specifying three concepts underneath thinking in organisational culture." src="images/food-safety-culture.WebP" title="Figure 1: Organisational culture, a Boolean approach." /></p>
<p>Presently, it’s all guesses on this front. So, here’s mine.</p>
<p>It may be possible to use Boolean variables to gauge alignment between different aspects of an organisation’s culture.</p>
<p>As shown in figure 1 (hover to enlarge), I learned from my research that at the most general level, organisational culture can be conceived as the intersection of dynamics related to three concepts: systems, practices/behaviours, and norms. From this model’s perspective, a healthy organisational culture is only feasible if there is positive reinforcement between the three aspects.</p>
<p>A hypothesis possible from the above is that even if one cannot see what is unknown, one may potentially gauge the effect of unknown organisational culture dynamics by testing alignment between known parts of said culture.<sup>2</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>If the data an organisation holds about itself shows consistency across the different aspects of organisational culture, the room for concern about unknown dynamics is minimal because these are not having harmful visible effects, at least not for the time being (and organisational culture must be assessed continuosly, so the assumption here is that misalignments would precede significant issues). </li>
<li>If data shows tensions, unknown dynamics may be having some harmful effects that could potentially become a bigger issue.</li>
<li>Where there is no alignment whatsoever, room for concern is maximal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>The general idea is applicable from all, qualitative, quantitative, and data analysis angles.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be implemented in an algorithm that is compatible with existing approaches to measuring organisational culture, to add to rather than replace what already exists.</p>
<p>Do get in touch if the idea picques your interest.</p>

<li>It’s hard to reference this paragraph accurately. The idea is a mesh of my published views and conversational brainstorming with Lone Jespersen, an expert in organisational culture in the food sector. Figure 1 comes directly from my research, alongside the interest in feedback across categories. She suggested visualising the sets as moving towards one another as maturity increases, which I think was a beautiful way to imagine the process.</li>

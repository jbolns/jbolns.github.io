<h1>Complexity and its many sources</h1>

<p>I recently had an interesting conversation about what is and is not a complex AI solutions. It reminded me that we often deem something complex or not based on the aspect of the process or system we care about. I wish I could say I am an exception, but this conversation proved that I am not.</p>
<p>The conversation was about AI uses. Someone asked for complex uses of AI. </p>
<p>I got the question wrong and forwarded an article about how <a href="https://www.polyzentrik.com/blog/sustainable-coffee-behind-scenes/">Auto-GPT helped me find new sustainable coffee brands</a> that I have yet to test.</p>
<p>I find this usage case fascinating because the AI managed to do something very complex. It came one section short of doing an excellent job as a market researcher, entirely by itself, even if my input into the process was straightforward: a prompt.</p>
<p>Alas, the person was looking for something more like process automation examples. From their perspective (I think), a use case is complex when the implementer does something complicated.</p>
<p>I found this fascinating. </p>
<ul>
<li>If one compares a prompt against the code needed to automate an industrial process, the code will likely be a more complex task. </li>
<li>If one compares the actions needed from AI to perform a repetitive process versus those required to deliver on an open-ended task, the open-ended challenge is likely the more complex feat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Goes to show. Complexity can come from many different sources, and we are not necessarily considering them all in our daily thinking. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Also, if this post feels rushed, it’s because it is. I am using my site to test some things. I needed a blog post written in Word for this (yes, that’s right, this post comes directly from a Word document – how cool is that!). I was out of writing ideas. Hehe! </p>
<p>Ah, yes! I also need to add an image to test something else. Here goes:</p>
